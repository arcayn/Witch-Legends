# Witch Legends

Witch Legends is a new text-based adventure game/engine/MMORPG. 
A lot of these files are either redundant stuff or text files with notes in them, so don't take this as a nice polished source.
None of this code is optimised yet at all.
If you want to run it, grab Visual Studio 2015 and stick this in your projects folder, this includes all the VS files you need.
Not that running it right now would be particularly interesting
